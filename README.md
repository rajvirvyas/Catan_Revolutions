# Catan Revolutions

 This is a 2-player version of the popular board game Catan. 
 
 It has most of the features important to the game, such as trading, building, and resource allocation.

The main appeal of our version is the AI Assist button, which suggests players where to build roads and settlements. 

This is done using decision-trees and rules-based systems used several different factors to determine which locations were the best to build settlements on for the player. These include distance to the playerâ€™s roads or settlements, the surrounding tile numbers, how badly the player needed specific resources, whether it was touching the coast or desert and the player needed more tokens, etc.
